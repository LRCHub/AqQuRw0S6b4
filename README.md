```
I was so high
I did not recognize
The fire burning in her eyes
The chaos that controlled
my mind
Whispered goodbye
and she got on a plane
Never to return again
But always in my heart
This love has
taken its toll on me
She said goodbye
too many times before
And her heart is
breakin' in front of me
I have no choice, 'cause
I won't say goodbye anymore
Whoa, whoa, whoa
I tried my best
to feed her appetite
Keep her coming every night
So hard to keep her satisfied
Kept playing love like
it was just a game
Pretending to feel the same
Then turn around and leave again
But uh-oh,
This love has
taken its toll on me
She said goodbye
too many times before
And her heart is
breakin' in front of me
I have no choice, 'cause
I won't say goodbye anymore
Whoa, whoa, whoa
I'll fix these broken things
Repair your broken wings
And make sure
everything's all right
(it's all right, it's all right)
My pressure on your hips
Sinking my fingertips
every inch of you
'Cause I know that's what you
want me to do
This love has
taken its toll on me
She said goodbye
too many times before
And her heart is
breakin' in front of me
I have no choice, 'cause
I won't say goodbye anymore
This love has
taken its toll on me
She said goodbye
too many times before
And her heart is
breakin' in front of me
She said goodbye
too many times before
This love has
taken its toll on me
She said goodbye
too many times before
And her heart is
breakin' in front of me
I have no choice, 'cause
I won't say goodbye anymore...
